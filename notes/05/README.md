## 1. More on Parsing

For "small" languages, i.e., languages without too much complexity in their syntax, recursive-descent parsing is often a reasonable strategy. With a little practice, it's often possible to type in a recursive-descent parser program, reading the grammar as a script. But in many cases, it's more convenient to make use of one of the many [parser generator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_parser_generators) utilities. 

#### Parser Generators

A *parser generator* is a program that accepts a context-free grammar (of one kind or another) and which generates a parser function in the compiler implementation language. The generated parser is integrated into the front-end of a compiler, situated between a tokenizer component and whatever compiler component follows parsing, usually elaboration or analysis. Parser generation has been one of the great success stories in computing.

In this course we're working with 4 little programming languages:

1. Mercury -- students write a recursive descent parser;
2. Venus -- a recursive descent parser is provided as part of the harness code;
3. Earth -- a recursive descent parser is provided as part of the harness code;
4. Mars/MiniC -- a parser produced by the ML-Yacc parser generator is provided as part of the harness code.

## Semantics

Let $P$ be a program. Two of the major foundational concerns of computer science are: A. how much work does $P$ do when executed? and B. what does $P$ mean? There are several approaches to specifying the semantics of a programming language ranging from reference compilers ("$P$ means what compiler $C$ says it means.") to informal text descriptions to formal approaches using mathematical models. Most approaches ascribe meanings to *abstract syntax*, that is, the essential structure of the program after all of the details of the concrete syntax have been stripped away.

> **Heads up!** From here on, we're primarily going to be working with abstract syntax rather than concrete syntax. Also, let $A$ be a non-terminal symbol in a CFG grammar such that $A\rightarrow^* w$.  In this case, $A$ defines the language ${\cal L}(A)$. From here on, we're going to feel free to use $A$ ambiguously as a non-terminal symbol, as the set ${\cal L}(A)$ and also as a typical element of ${\cal L}(A)$.

#### Denotational Semantics

The denotational idea is simple on its face: the meaning of a program is an element of mathematical set, a so-called *semantic domain*. This approach was pioneered by [Christopher Strachey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Strachey) and [Dana Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana_Scott) at the University of Oxford in the early 1970s. The Scott-Strachey approach generally works very well though the sets serving as semantic domains require special structure (they are [complete partial-orders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_partial_order)) and the mathematical functions serving as meanings of programs are required to preserve the order. Further details on this can be found in the lecture notes in `hutr0692.pdf`.

One of the attractive aspects of the Scott-Strachey approach is that the same semantic domains can be used for meanings of programs in different languages. This can be useful in verifying the correctness of translation -- one would have to show that the source program and the translated program denote the same semantic value.

#### Operational Semantics

As its name suggests, the operational approach is generally concerned with machine states and the transitions between states that arise during the step-by-step execution of a program. The semantics relates initial states to final states. The operational approach was developed over many years and with contributions from many people, including [Peter Landin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Landin). But operational semantics was fully developed in its modern from by [Gordon Plotkin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gordon_Plotkin). Plotkin is known in particular for the widely-used [Structural Approach to Operational Semantics](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/gdp/publications/sos_jlap.pdf) (or SOS). This kind of semantics is sometimes calls "small-step" because each state transition step is explicitly specified.

The computation steps in an operational semantics are often specified using an *axiomatic system* with inference rules of the form

```
                            antecendent1; ... ; antecedentk
                          ------------------------------------
                                       consequent
```

The items occurring in an inference rule will usually be *judgments*. In the simple examples here they are of the form `E -+-> E'`, pronounced "`E` steps to `E'`". We'll use the symbol `-+->` both as this syntactic item but also for the relation the system defines:
$$
\mathtt{-\!+\!-\!>} = \{ (E, E')\mid E\mathtt{-\!+\!-\!>}E' \mathrm{\ is\ derivable\ from\ the\ rules}\}
$$
We'll use the symbol `-+->*` for the relation defined by zero or more steps of `-+->`. The inference rules define an evaluation relation 
$$
\mathit{Eval} \subseteq E \times V = \{ (E, V)\mid E\ \mathtt{-\!+\!-\!>}^*\ V\}
$$
**Example**

Abstract syntax

```
V ::= i           i an integer
E ::= V | E + E
```

Operational Semantics

We have 3 rules.

```
           E1 -+-> E1'                  E -+-> E'               add(V1, V2) = V
    -------------------------     ---------------------     -----------------------
      E1 + E2 -+-> E1' + E2         V + E -+-> V + E'           V1 + V2 -+-> V
```

Example

```
                            add(2, 3) = 5         
                        ---------------------   
                            2 + 3 -+-> 5            add(5, 4) = 9
                     --------------------------   ------------------
                       (2 + 3) + 4 -+-> 5 + 4;      5 + 4 -+-> 9
                     -----------------------------------------------(Transitivity)
                                  (2 + 3) + 4 -+->* 9
```

##### Evaluation Semantics

In this course, we're going to define the evaluation relation Eval using a less precise relation which abstracts away the individual computation steps. This is sometime called *Natural Semantics* or *Big Step* semantics. It is due to [Giles Kahn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operational_semantics#Natural_semantics). 

```
                                      E1 | V1;  E2 | V2;  add(V1, V2) = V
       --------------------       ------------------------------------------
              V | V                             E1 + E2 | V
```

Then the evaluation relation doesn't require a transitive and reflexive closure
$$
Eval = \{ (E, V)\mid E \mid V \mathrm{\ is\ derivable\ from\ the\ rules}\}
$$
