### Planned Schedule of Topics

1. Introduction & background
2. Introduction to OCaml
3. More OCaml
4. Syntax & grammars
5. Mercury: parsing; natural semantics & evaluation
6. Venus: variables & multiple types; binding & scope; substitution & environments
7. Venus evaluation order: call-by-value & call-by-name
8. Typing Venus, Type Inference
9. Compiling Venus to MIPS
10. Earth: Block-Structured recursive functions, structured types
11. MiniC: Compiling to MIPS
12. Lambda Calculus
13. System F; Generics
14. Memory Safety, Review & wrap-up

### Grading

Like most CS courses, CSCI 3366 is very much a "learn by doing" course. Because of the nature of the pandemic and hybrid mode teaching, this year all grades will be determined by problem sets. Grades will be computed on a 120 point scale, over 1 warm-up logistical exercise + 10 planned problem set parts. The tentative topics of the assignments and points are distributed as follows:

0. Join (2 Points) — joining GitHub, system configuration
1. Getting Started With OCaml (1) (10 Points)
2. More Steps with OCaml (2) (6 Points)
3. Tokens and Trees (10 Points)
4. Grammars & Parsing (12 Points) --- A grammar for Java and a parser for Mercury
5. A Call-by-Name Interpreter for Venus (12 Points)
6. A Type Checker for Earth (12 Points)
7. MiniC Compiler: Name, Unify (14 Points)
8. MiniC Compiler: Lift, Infer (14 Points)
9. MiniC Compiler: Control (14 Points)
10. MiniC Compiler: Codegen (14 Points)

#### Notes:

+ Unless specified otherwise, problem sets must be submitted by pushing your repository to GitHub by the deadline. Generally speaking, problem set deadlines will be **Tuesdays at 6PM**.

+ Late problem sets will be penalized 19% each day.
+ Any violation of the [university's policy on academic integrity](http://www.bc.edu/offices/stserv/academic/integrity.html) will result in a failing grade for the course.

### Textbooks

This course is self-contained, and there is no required textbook. If you are interested in reading more, Prof. Muller prepared a list of recommendations in previous versions of the course that you can read [here](./resources/textbooks.md).
